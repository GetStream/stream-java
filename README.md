## 📝 About Stream

You can sign up for a Stream account at our [Get Started](https://getstream.io/activity-feeds/docs/java/?language=java) page.

You can use this library to access feeds API endpoints server-side.

For the client-side integrations (web and mobile) have a look at the JavaScript, iOS and Android SDK libraries ([docs](https://getstream.io/activity-feeds/)).

> 💡 Note: this is a library for the **Feeds** product. The Chat SDKs can be found [here](https://getstream.io/chat/docs/).

## ⚙️ Installation

Add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.getstream.client</groupId>
    <artifactId>stream-java</artifactId>
    <version>${stream_version}</version>
</dependency>
```

or in your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
implementation 'io.getstream.client:stream-java:$stream_version'
```

In case you want to download the artifact and put it manually into your project,
you can download it from [here](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-java/releases).

Snapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/io/getstream/client/) snapshots repository.

> 💡This API Client project requires Java SE 7.

## 🙋 FAQ

1. Is Android supported?

Yes. Use `client` for your backend and use `CloudClient` for your mobile application.

2. Cannot construct an instance of `io.getstream.core.models.*`, a model object in android. What is the problem?

If you're using proguard, ensure having following: `-keep class io.getstream.core.models.** { *; }`

Additionally, we're using Jackson JSON processor and see [their definitions](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-docs/wiki/JacksonOnAndroid) too unless you're already using it.
